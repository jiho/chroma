\title{Get or set the relative brightness of colors}
\usage{
luminance(x)

luminance(x) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of colors specified as hex strings or named R colors.}

\item{value}{the luminance value, as a number in [0,1]}
}
\value{
For \code{luminance}, a vector of luminance values, each in [0,1].

For \code{luminance<-}, the updated object(s).

\description{
Get or set the relative brightness of colors
}
\details{
\code{luminance} gets the relative brightness of colors, normalised to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white according to the WCAG definition \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#relativeluminancedef}.

\code{luminance<-} sets the relative brightness by interpolating with black or white until the appropriate relative luminance is found. The changes in luminance are not reversible because the interpolation to black or white changes various aspects of the color simultaneously: its lightness of course but also its intensity and even possibly its hue (at the extreme, black or white have no well-defined hue).
}
\examples{
luminance("black")
luminance("white")
luminance("red")

# Colors along a HSV rainbow have very different relative brightness
luminance(rainbow(6))
# but brightness is much more homogenous along a HCL "rainbow"
luminance(hcl(h=seq(0, 360, length.out=6)))

# Change the luminance
col <- "red"
luminance(col) <- 0.5
show_col(c("red", col))

# This can even be used to create color ramps, although the steps in
# perceived brightness may not be regular at the extremes
col <- "red"
luminance(col) <- seq(0, 1, length.out=10)
show_col(col)
# Better to avoid the extremes then
col <- "red"
luminance(col) <- seq(0.1, 0.9, length.out=10)
show_col(col)
}
